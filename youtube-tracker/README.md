YouTube makes it possible for anyone to create and share video content, and
engage with viewers around the world. While the built-in analytics and
notification options provided by YouTube are designed for a user's own channel,
you may care deeply about content that extends beyond those bounds.

This solution uses the YouTube Data API to track performance of a user-curated
list of public YouTube videos, including views, likes, and comments, in a Google
Sheet. Additionally, email notifications can be enabled that send daily
summaries of videos that have new comment activity so that you can engage with
questions and comments shared for the video.

## Technology highlights

- Uses the [YouTube advanced service](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/advanced/youtube)
  to collect data on specific videos (such as number of views and comment data)
  via the YouTube Data API.
- Uses the [Gmail Service](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/gmail/)
  to send notification emails when new video comments are detected.
- Creates an [HTML template](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/html/templates#calling_apps_script_functions_from_a_template)
  containing an Apps Script function to send custom notification emails.

## Try it

### Spreadsheet setup

1. Make of copy of the spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12rQe1ndU_VmmHl0QIqUi-XxQ8lWovjh0xfOHTfxOHoo/copy).
   It already contains the Apps Script code for the solution.
1. Change the name of the sheet to the full email address where you’d like to
   receive email notifications.
1. Locate URLs of videos you would like to track and add them in column A below
   cell A1.

### YouTube Advanced Service setup

1. From the spreadsheet, open the script editor by selecting **Tools > Script**
   editor.
1. In the script editor, select **Resources > Advanced Google services**.
1. In the Advanced Google Service dialog that appears, click the on/off switch
   next to the YouTube Data API service.
1. Click **OK** in the dialog.

### Test the code

1. From the script editor, choose `markVideos` from the select box in the
   toolbar, then click the Run button (▶).
1. When prompted, click the **Review permissions** button.
1. Select your G Suite account from the list.
1. Click the **Allow** button.
1. When the script execution completes, you should see the details added in
   columns C through H, and you will receive an email for any videos that have
   more than zero comments. When running the function in the future, you will
   only receive an email with videos whose comment count has increased since the
   last time the script was run.
1. Optionally, to turn off email notifications, change line 2 of `code.gs` from
   `'Y'` to `'N'`.

### Apps Script trigger setup

Instead of running the script manually, set it up to run at regular intervals
(such as once a day).

1. From the script editor, choose **Edit > Current project's triggers**.
1. Click the link that says **No triggers set up. Click here to add one now**.
1. Under **Run**, select the `markVideos` function.
1. Under **Select event source**, choose **Time-driven**.
1. Under **Select type of time based trigger**, select **Day timer**.
1. Under **Select hour interval**, choose a desired time interval such as 6am to
   7am.
1. Optionally, click **Notifications** to configure how and when you are
   contacted by email if your triggered function fails.
1. Click **Save**.
