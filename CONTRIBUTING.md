## Contributing a Solution

The Solutions Gallery is accepting Apps Script contributions from the community. If you have an
idea for a solution to include, follow these steps:

## Step 1

Use this [issue template][issue_template] to submit an idea. We define a solution as an end-to-end
use case or workflow that solves a real business problem. A solution should solve a plausible
business use case. A solution should NOT be a feature or utility of specific products/APIs.

Yes: Manage employee timesheets
No: Use the Sheets API onEdit trigger to send notifications

Once you have approval from one of the repo owners, proceed to the next step.

[issue_template]: https://github.com/gsuitedevs/solutions/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement+%28new+solution%29&template=new-solution-request.md&title=

## Step 2

Implement your solution and use the [template directory][template_directorhy] to structure your
code sample. If your solution involves a spreadsheet, document or presentation, please include
sample data in the data directory (see [example][data_example]). You must fill in the 
[README.md][template_readme] with an image or gif for us to surface on the gallery page. 

[template_directory]: https://github.com/gsuitedevs/solutions/tree/master/template
[template_readme]: https://github.com/gsuitedevs/solutions/tree/master/template
[data_example]: https://github.com/gsuitedevs/solutions/tree/master/equipment-requests

## Step 3

Send a pull request when ready for review. When your solution is merged, we will add it to the
gallery view.

### Issue monitoring

We monitor all feedback for solutions added to the gallery. If we discover a problem with your 
solution code, we will file an issue against you in this repo. All issues assigned to you should
be addressed within two weeks.

We reserve the right to edit or remove solutions in the gallery if they become outdated, lack of
maintenance, or another concernt. If your solution is removed, you are welcome to resubmit an 
updated version at a later time.
