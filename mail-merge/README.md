Simplify the process of producing visually rich mail merges using Gmail and combining it with data from Google Sheets. With this solution you can automatically populate an email template created as a Gmail draft with data from Google Sheets. Merged emails are sent from your Gmail account allowing you to respond to recipient replies.

## Technology highlights

* Uses the [Gmail Service](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/gmail/) to read drafts and to send emails.

* Uses  [SpreadsheetApp service](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/spreadsheet-app) to read and write data.

## Try it

1. Create a copy of the sample [Gmail/Sheets Mail Merge spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EfjLuYGab8Xt8wCn4IokBIG0_W4tBtiU4vxl3Y7FPsA/copy).

1. Update the **Recipients** column with email addresses you would like to use in the mail merge

1. Create a draft message in your Gmail account using markers like `{{First name}}`, which correspond to column names, to indicate text youâ€™d like to be replaced with data from the copied spreadsheet. 

1. In the copied spreadsheet, click on custom menu item **Mail Merge > Send Emails**.

1. A dialog box will appear and tell you that the script requires authorization. Read the authorization notice and continue.

1. When prompted enter or copy/paste the subject line used in your draft Gmail message and click **OK**

1. The **Email Sent** column will update with the message status.

## Next steps

Additional columns can be added to the spreadsheet with other data you would like to use. Using the `{{}}` annotation and including your column name as part of your Gmail draft will allow you to include other data from your spreadsheet. If you change the name of the **Recipient** or **Email Sent** columns this will need to be updated by opening **Tools > Script Editor**.

The source code includes a number of additional parameters, currently commented out, which can be used to control the name of the account email is sent from, reply to email addresses, as well as bcc and cc'd email addresses.
