Simplify how your employees do expense reporting with a Gmail Add-on and Google Sheets. Anytime a
user receives an email receipt, they can open the add-on which automatically contains relevant
information about the expense. Users can edit that information and then submit the form to log
their expense into a spreadsheet.

## Technology highlights

- Use the [Card Service][cardservice] for Gmail add-ons to build a UI to works both on web and
