When you wake up feeling ill the last thing you want to do is log in to your
work account and update your status in multiple applications. With this
solution, you simply send the message "I'm sick" to a custom bot in Hangouts
Chat and it will turn on your out of office message in Gmail and block off
your day in Google Calendar.

## Technology highlights

- Uses the [Hangouts Chat API][hangouts_chat_api] to build a chat bot, which you
  can message just like a human participant.
- The bot is implemented using [Apps Script][apps_script], allowing for rapid
  development and worry-free operation.
- Uses the [Gmail API][gmail_api] to set the user's out-of-office
  auto-responder.
- Blocks off the user's calendar using the [Calendar API][calendar_api].
