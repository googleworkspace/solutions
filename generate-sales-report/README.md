Annual and quarterly reports are a standard part of business 
for many enterprises. Luckily, automation can help eliminate the 
repetition inherent in these periodic obligations. 
If you find yourself needing to analyze and present findings 
from large sets of stored data, consider using automation 
to help streamline your reporting. 

This solution creates a tool that connects to sales data in 
[BigQuery][bigquery], an analytics data warehouse, from directly within 
Google Sheets. A configuration sheet allows a user to provide 
parameters for the report, such as the _Account Name_ and 
_Region_. With the click of a button, a customized report
with the latest sales data is automatically created in just 
a matter of seconds!

Note: This solution requires a Google Workspace Enterprise account and a Google Cloud Platform account and 
project.

## Technology highlights

- Uses the [Sheets data connector for BigQuery][connector-support]
  to access tables in a data warehouse from directly 
  within Google Sheets.
- Uses [Google Slides][google-slides] to create a templatized 
  report.
- Uses [Apps Script][apps-script] to 
  create a chart in Google Sheets, and merge it, along with 
  sales data, into the template report.

## Try it

### Set up a Google Cloud Platform project
This solution requires a [Google Cloud Platform account and project][gcp-account]. The service used in this solution, BigQuery, 
has a [sandbox environment][sandbox] 
that you can use to test this solution.

1. [Sign in][sign-in] with your Google Workspace Business, Enterprise, 
or Education Account credentials. 
1. In the [GCP Console][console], select or create a new GCP project.

### Create a templatized slide deck

1. Make a copy of the template slide deck [here][slide-deck].
1. Identify the unique ID of your Slides document. The ID can 
be derived from the URL: `https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/`_**`slideId`**_`/edit`

### Set up the configuration spreadsheet

1. Make of copy of the template spreadsheet [here][spreadsheet].
1. From the spreadsheet, open the script editor by selecting

### Generate a new report

1. Navigate to the Generator tab of your spreadsheet.
1. Choose an _Account Name_ and _Region_ in drop-down cells.
1. Navigate to the Data Results tab and click **Refresh** 
in the bottom left-hand corner of the spreadsheet grid.   
1. Return to the Generator tab and click on the large 
Generate button at the bottom of the spreadsheet grid to 
initiate the creation of the report.
1. When prompted, click the **Review permissions** button.
1. Select your Google Workspace account from the list.
