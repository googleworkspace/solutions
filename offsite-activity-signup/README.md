Quickly create an end to end offsite activity signup system. Start with the activity schedule in a Google Sheet, then
use Apps Script to create a form for attendees to express their preferences. After everyone submits their responses,
assign the activities to best match their preferences, activity capacities, and schedules.

## Technology highlights

- The [`FormApp` service][formapp-docs]
  is used to create a sign-up form based on a schedule of activities in the sheet.
- The [`SpreadsheetApp` service][spreadsheetapp-docs]
  is used to read the form responses and record the activity assignments and rosters
  in the spreadsheet.
  
## Try it

1. Create a copy of the sample [Offsite Activity Signup spreadsheet][sheet].
1. Click on custom menu item **Activities** > **Create Form**.
1. A dialog box will appear and tell you that the script requires authorization. Read the authorization notice
   and continue.
1. You will see a new **Form** menu. Click it and select **Go to live form**.
1. Fill out the form and submit your response.
1. Return to the sheet.
1. Click on custom menu item **Activities > Generate test data** to generate additional responses.
1. Click on custom menu item **Activities > Assign activities**.
1. Two new sheets will appear with the activity assignments. View them.
