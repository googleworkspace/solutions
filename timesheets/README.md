Quickly create a hands-free employee pay management system. Start with
collecting employees' timesheets in a Google Form, then use
[Apps Script][apps-script] to create a spreadsheet to easily view, compile, and
manage their data. After everybody submits their responses, calculate their pay,
approve or disapprove their pay, and auto-send emails notifying them of their
pay status.

## Technology highlights

-   The script uses [MailApp][mail-app] to send employees automated emails.
-   The solution uses [Data Validation Rules][data-val] to populate drop-down
    values.

## Set-Up Instructions

1.  Create a copy of the sample [Timesheets Responses][sheet-link] Google Sheet.
1.  Inside of this sheet, you will see a new **Timesheets** menu. Click it and
    select **Form Setup**.
1.  A dialog box will appear and tell you that the script requires
    authorization. Read the authorization notice and continue.
1.  Once **Form Setup** finishes running, you will see a new Form in your Google
    Drive entitled "Employee Weekly Timesheets". You can now send this Form out
    to your employees & have them fill in their information accordingly. You
    will see any new Form responses fill into new rows of your Sheet.
1.  Once you've received responses, go back to the **Timesheets** menu and
    select **Column Setup**.
1.  You will now see columns for weekly pay values, approval status, and
    notified status.
1.  You will notice that the **WEEKLY PAY** column is full of values - these
    were calculated upon setup, so the work is taken care of for you.
1.  Use the drop down values of the **APPROVAL** column to either approve or
    disapprove each employeeâ€™s weekly pay.
1.  Click on **Timesheets > Notify Employees** in order to auto-send emails to
    every employee notifying them of their approval status. You will see the
    values in the **NOTIFIED** column change.
