A shared vacation calendar is a great tool for helping your team collaborate;
anyone can determine who's out of the office at a glance. However, booking time
off is already a chore, and an additional step to update the calendar can be
easy to forget.

This solution uses [Google Apps Script][apps-script] to automatically populate
a shared vacation calendar based on the individual calendars of each person on
the team. When someone books time off they just need to remember to add an event
to their personal Google Calendar using a keyword like "Vacation" or "Out of
office". The script acts behind the scenes, scanning the calendars of all the
members in a Google Group and syncing appropriate events to the shared calendar.

Note: This solution only accesses Calendar events that your colleagues have made
visible to you via their [privacy settings][privacy_settings].

## Technology highlights

- The script runs automatically on a fixed schedule using Apps Script's
  [time-driven triggers][time_driven_triggers].
- The [`GroupsApp` service][groupsapp] is used to determine the members of the
  team's Google Group.
- The [Advanced Calendar Service][calendar_advanced] provides access to the
  [Calendar API][calendar_api] and the ability to search for events on your
  colleague's calendar.

Next, create the Apps Script project:

1. Open the [Apps Script project][project] in your browser.
1. Click the menu item **File > Make a copy...**.
1. Set the variable `TEAM_CALENDAR_ID` to the ID of the calendar you
   created earlier.
1. Set the variable `GROUP_EMAIL` to the email address of a Google Group
   containing your team members.

Then run the script:

1. Click the **Select function** dropdown and select **setup**.
1. Click the Run button (â–º).
1. When prompted, click the **Review permissions** button.
1. Select your G Suite account from the list.
1. Click the **Allow** button.

When complete, return to Google Calendar to see the Team Vacations calendar
populated with events. For a more detailed record of what the script did, you
